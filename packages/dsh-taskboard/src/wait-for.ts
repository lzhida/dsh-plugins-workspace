 * Deterministic waiting for tests: poll a condition at a small step until it

 * `setTimeout` sleeps that guessed at fsync/rename latency (Windows: atomic
 * persists can exceed 10ms now and then) — the wait ends the moment the
 * target ledger/DOM state actually appears.
 *
 * The condition may be sync or async:
 * - returning `false` (or a promise resolving to `false`) → not ready yet;
 * - returning anything else / `void` → satisfied;
 * - throwing → treated as "not ready yet" and retried; the LAST error is
 *   re-thrown on timeout so a genuinely broken condition stays diagnosable.
